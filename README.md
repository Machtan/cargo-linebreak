# Why?
I found it a bit difficult to distinguish my compilation errors with 'cargo watch', so I thought I'd make something to fix that.

# How?
```
cargo watch linebreak check
```
or something similar

# Install
```
cargo install cargo-watch
cargo install cargo-linebreak
```

# Usage
```
cargo-linebreak --help
```
Will get you the options
